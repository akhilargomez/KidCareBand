## ThingSpeak Configuration

### Channel Setup
1. Create a ThingSpeak account at https://thingspeak.com
2. Create a new channel with the following fields:
   - **Field 1**: Latitude
   - **Field 2**: Longitude
   - **Field 3**: Alert Type
   - **Field 4**: Alert Message

### API Keys
Update the following credentials in the code:

```cpp
// WiFi Credentials
const char* ssid = "YourWiFiSSID";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";

// ThingSpeak Credentials
String writeAPIKey = "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY";
String readAPIKey = "YOUR_READ_API_KEY";
String channelID = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID";
```

## Code Headers Reference

The following headers are included in the code:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>              // ESP32 WiFi connectivity
#include <HTTPClient.h>        // HTTP requests to ThingSpeak
#include <Wire.h>              // I2C communication for OLED
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>      // Graphics library for OLED
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>  // OLED display driver
#include <TinyGPS++.h>         // GPS data parsing
#include <HardwareSerial.h>    // Serial communication for GPS
```

## Upload Instructions

1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. Select the correct COM port: **Tools → Port**
3. Set upload speed to **115200** (Tools → Upload Speed)
4. Click the **Upload** button
5. Monitor output via **Tools → Serial Monitor** (set to 115200 baud)

## Features

### GPS Tracking
- Continuously reads GPS coordinates
- Updates location to ThingSpeak every 15 seconds
- Displays latitude and longitude on serial monitor

### Alert System
- Retrieves alert type and messages from ThingSpeak
- Displays alerts on OLED screen
- Activates vibration motor for alerts
- Shows motivational messages when no alerts present

### Display Modes
- **Normal Mode**: "Stay Happy, Stay Hydrated, Stay Healthy"
- **Alert Mode**: Shows alert type and custom message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OLED Not Displaying**
- Check I2C address (default: 0x3C)
- Verify SDA/SCL connections
- Test with I2C scanner sketch

**GPS Not Getting Fix**
- Ensure GPS module has clear view of sky
- Allow 2-5 minutes for initial fix
- Check RX/TX pin connections

**WiFi Connection Failed**
- Verify SSID and password
- Check WiFi signal strength
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)

**ThingSpeak Upload Issues**
- Verify API keys and channel ID
- Check internet connectivity
- Ensure 15-second minimum interval between updates

## Testing Procedure

1. Upload code and open Serial Monitor
2. Verify WiFi connection
3. Wait for GPS fix (coordinates should appear)
4. Check ThingSpeak channel for GPS updates
5. Send test alert through ThingSpeak
6. Verify alert display and vibration
