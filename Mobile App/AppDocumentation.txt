KidCareBand: Mobile Application & Cloud Integration 📱☁️
1. Development Platform
* MIT App Inventor: The application was built using this block-based visual programming tool. It allows for rapid prototyping of the user interface and logic without complex text-based coding.
* Source File: The .aia file included in this folder can be imported into MIT App Inventor for editing or remixing.

2. Cloud Architecture (ThingSpeak)
* The app does not communicate directly with the ESP32. Instead, it uses ThingSpeak as a "middleman" to store and retrieve data.
* Data Aggregation: The ESP32 sends GPS coordinates and alert triggers to a ThingSpeak channel using HTTP POST requests.
* Real-Time Retrieval: The mobile app uses the Web Component in App Inventor to fetch this data using the ThingSpeak Read API.
* Visualizations: Parents can give alerts to children through the app and also they can track the child's location through the app.

3. App Functionality
* Location Tracking: Displays the child's last known GPS coordinates on a Google Maps interface within the app.
* Alert: Parents can give hydration alert to ensure child is drinking water, or taking medicine on time or the school bus time alert through the app to enable the haptic indication and display indication on the band.
* Connectivity Check: Monitors the "Status" field to ensure the wearable is currently online and transmitting data.

4. Setup Instructions for Educators
  To make this app work with your own hardware:
 * Create a free account at ThingSpeak.com.
 * Set up a new Channel with fields for Latitude, Longitude, and Status.
 * Copy your Channel ID and Read API Key.
 * In the MIT App Inventor blocks, update the URL variables with your specific Channel credentials.
