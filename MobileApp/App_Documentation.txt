KidCareBand: Mobile Application & Cloud Integration 📱☁️
1. Development Platform
 * MIT App Inventor: The application was built using this block-based visual programming tool. It allows for rapid prototyping of the user interface and logic without complex text-based coding.
 * Source File: The .aia file included in this folder can be imported into MIT App Inventor for editing or remixing.

2. Cloud Architecture (ThingSpeak)
 * The app does not communicate directly with the ESP32. Instead, it uses ThingSpeak as a "middleman" to store and retrieve data.
 * Data Aggregation: The ESP32 sends GPS coordinates and alert triggers to a ThingSpeak channel using HTTP POST requests.
 * Real-Time Retrieval: The mobile app uses the Web Component in App Inventor to fetch this data using the ThingSpeak Read API.
 * Visualizations: Parents can view live graphs of data directly on the ThingSpeak dashboard or through the labels/maps in the app.

3. App Functionality
 * Location Tracking: Displays the child's last known GPS coordinates on a Google Maps interface within the app.
 * Alert Logs: Shows a history of "Panic Button" presses and sensor alerts (e.g., medicine or hydration reminders).
 * Connectivity Check: Monitors the "Status" field to ensure the wearable is currently online and transmitting data.

4. Setup Instructions for ThingSpeak
  To make this app work with your own hardware:
 * Create a free account at ThingSpeak.com.
 * Set up a new Channel with fields for Latitude, Longitude, and Status.
 * Copy your Channel ID and Read API Key.
 * In the MIT App Inventor blocks, update the URL variables with your specific Channel credentials.
